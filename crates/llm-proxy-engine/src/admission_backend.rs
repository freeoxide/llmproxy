//! The shared-state seam behind [`Admission`](crate::Admission) (plan 09
//! step 1, audit conflict 13): one trait, [`AdmissionBackend`], owns every
//! limit, window, budget and concurrency counter the one admission step
//! enforces. The default backend is the in-process
//! [`MemoryAdmissionBackend`] (one `Mutex`, exactly the pre-plan-09
//! behaviour); the optional `llm-proxy-store-redis` and
//! `llm-proxy-store-postgres` crates implement the same trait against a
//! shared store so replicas enforce one budget between them. The rules —
//! allowlists, estimates, refusals, statuses — stay in
//! [`PolicyAdmission`](crate::PolicyAdmission), so no backend can drift
//! into its own admission policy.
//!
//! Money crosses this seam as [`MicroUsd`] (scaled fixed-point, 1e-6 USD),
//! never a float, matching the workspace's money rule.
