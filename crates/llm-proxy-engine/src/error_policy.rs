//! The one client-status policy (audit conflict 14, plan 05 step 1): every
//! HTTP status the proxy can produce, in one table, with the deliberate
//! `x-should-retry` choice for each.
//!
//! Stock SDKs auto-retry a fixed set of statuses (the OpenAI and Anthropic
//! SDKs both retry 408, 409, 429 and 5xx by default, and both honour an
//! `x-should-retry` response header over their built-in list), so a status
//! emitted without a policy silently multiplies load. Every status the
//! engine can name ([`EngineError::status_code`], including the upstream
//! passthrough set of [`crate::map_upstream_status`]) and every status the
//! server can name must be a row here; tests on both sides enforce that.
//!
//! The rules, in one place:
//!
//! - Client-fixable failures (400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 413, 402) say
//!   `x-should-retry: false`: the same request will fail the same way until
//!   the client or operator changes something.
//! - The proxy's own timeout (408) and the in-flight idempotency conflict
//!   (409) say `true`: both clear by themselves within a bounded, short
//!   window.
//! - Rate windows (429) say `true` and carry `Retry-After` with the window
//!   reset when the proxy knows it.
//! - Spend budgets (402) say `false` even though the budget eventually
//!   resets: an SDK retry ladder cannot wait out a day-long window, and
//!   hammering a capped key hides the signal from its owner.
//! - Upstream faults (502, 503, 504) say `true` — unless the proxy's own
//!   ladder already retried them, in which case
//!   [`EngineError::RetryExhausted`] overrides the row and says `false`
//!   (plan 04 step 12).
//! - The proxy's own bugs (500) say `false`: a retry re-runs the same bug
//!   and multiplies load without evidence it helps.
