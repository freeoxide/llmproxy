# 05. Admission and budgets

- **Status:** Not started
- **Depends on:** 04
- **Audit rows:** None
- **Code-audit bugs:** BUG-24
- **Backlog:** 4, 6, 18, 22, 30
- **Conflicts:** 2, 8, 12, 14, 15

Decide in one place whether a request may run, and what it costs. The research
proposes three different admission models, and this plan replaces them with one.

## To do

1. **Error policy (conflict 14).** Keep one table in one module for 402, 408, 409,
   429, 503 and `x-should-retry`. Stock SDKs retry some of these automatically, so
   each code needs a deliberate choice.
2. **Key lookup (conflict 12).** A cache miss in
   `crates/llm-proxy-server/src/middleware.rs` tries every key in turn, so 1,000 keys
   means about 1,000 argon2 runs per bad token. Use a key-id prefix and one
   verification.
3. **Per-key allowlists (backlog 18).** Add model and provider globs, and fail closed
   when a request has no identifiable model.
4. **One admission step (backlog 6, conflict 2).** Reserve, then settle or refund. A
   cost that can't be estimated goes to an explicit per-key policy. This lives in the
   `Admission` trait from plan 03, not in `llm-proxy-core`.
5. **Limit windows (backlog 6).** Add RPM, TPM, RPD and per-key budgets, using the
   attempt rows from plan 04.
6. **What counts (conflict 8).** Budgets charge what providers bill, per attempt.
   Cache hits charge nothing and are recorded as hits.
7. **Concurrency caps (backlog 30).** Limit in-flight requests per provider and model.
   When saturated, return 503 with a short `Retry-After`, not 429.
8. **Preflight (backlog 4, conflict 15).** Warn by default. Reject only with a safety
   margin or a provider token count, because non-OpenAI estimates use chars/4 and
   counting ignores tools, tool results and images.
9. **Pricing (backlog 22, BUG-24).** Add an opt-in sync from models.dev and an explicit
   unpriced state. Unpriced rows never show as $0 in summaries.

## Done when

- Concurrent requests can't overspend a budget by more than the reserved amount.
- A refund restores the budget when a request fails before any cost.
- Lookup cost for a bad token doesn't grow with the number of keys.
- Every status code the proxy produces is in the policy table, and a test enforces it.
