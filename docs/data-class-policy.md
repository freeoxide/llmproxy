# Data-class policy

What the proxy stores, where, and for how long. Prompts and responses are
**not stored by default**; every store below that holds them is an opt-in.

## What is stored by default

| Data | Stored | Where | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Usage ledger rows | Yes, when `[storage]` is set | SQLite (`usage.db`) | `max_age` / `max_rows` from `[storage]`; forever if unset |
| Ledger rows (no `[storage]`) | In memory only, discarded | none | none |
| Prompt bytes | No | — | — |
| Response bytes | No | — | — |
| Body digests | SHA-256 of the raw request body, on ledger rows | with the row | with the row |
| Caller identity | Key id or `"anonymous"`, on ledger rows | with the row | with the row |

The ledger never carries prompt or response content: rows hold digests,
token counts, costs, model names and error kinds. A test
(`cache_and_dedup::with_every_opt_in_off_nothing_is_stored_and_every_request_runs`)
asserts that no recorded row contains prompt or response text.

## Opt-in stores

### Response cache — `[server.cache] enabled = true`

- **Stores:** complete non-streaming responses (the decoded response:
  content, usage, cost, stop reason), keyed by caller, provider, route,
  upstream model and body digest. Streaming responses are shared while in
  flight (single-flight) but never stored.
- **Where:** in process memory. Nothing is written to disk. A restart
  empties it.
- **Retention:** `ttl` (default 10m) from storage; at most `max_entries`
  (default 1000), oldest stored evicted first.
- **Served to:** the same caller only. Keys include the caller identity, so
  one caller's stored response is never returned to another.

### `Idempotency-Key` replay — `[server.idempotency] enabled = true`

- **Stores:** the completed outcome of a request that carried an
  `Idempotency-Key` header: the full response (non-streaming) or the full
  collected event list (streaming), keyed by caller + key. The body digest
  and provider route are stored alongside for match checking. Requests
  without the header store nothing.
- **Where:** in process memory. Nothing is written to disk.
- **Retention:** `ttl` (default 24h) from completion, swept as it passes; at
  most `max_entries` (default 1000) completed outcomes, oldest completed
  evicted first. Failed requests are not stored — their key is released so a
  retry executes.
- **While in flight:** the first request holds the key; a concurrent request
  with the same key gets 409 until it finishes. Nothing is stored for the
  conflict itself.

### Single-flight — always on, stores nothing

- Identical concurrent requests from one caller share one upstream call.
  The leader's events and outcome are held in memory **only while requests
  are waiting on them**, then dropped. Nothing persists after completion;
  there is no TTL because there is no storage.
- A joiner shares the leader's fate while attached: if the leader is refused
  (guard, budget) or fails before its first byte, the joiner gets the same
  error, and if the leader goes away entirely before its first byte the
  joiner re-runs the request once itself. Once a shared stream has committed,
  a disconnecting leader ends it for its joiners too — they receive the
  events collected so far followed by an in-band error, not the remainder of
  the response.

### Prompt-cache hygiene — `[provider.prompt_cache]`

- **Stores:** nothing. It edits outgoing request bytes (strips configured
  volatile pointers, optionally injects cache markers) at the provider
  edge. It reads `[provider.prompt_cache]` from config; no request or
  response data is retained.

## Opt-in stores from the optional crates (plan 09)

Each crate below is compiled in only behind its cargo feature; with the
feature off, nothing it would store exists anywhere.

### Semantic cache — `[server.semantic_cache] enabled = true` (the
`semantic-cache` feature)

- **Stores:** per caller, the embedding of each cached prompt and the
  complete non-streaming response it produced, bucketed by caller,
  provider and model. Streaming responses are never stored (a streaming
  lookup misses).
- **Where:** in process memory. Nothing is written to disk; a restart
  empties it.
- **Retention:** `ttl` (default 10m) from storage; at most `max_entries`
  (default 256) per caller, oldest evicted first.
- **Served to:** the same caller only — the caller is part of the bucket
  key, so one caller's stored response is never returned to another. A
  stored prompt must reach the `threshold` cosine similarity (default
  0.95) to be served; `1.0` behaves like an exact cache.
- **Note:** the default embedder is offline and deterministic (hashed
  character trigrams); it stores only the derived vector, never the
  prompt text.

### Managed client keys — `[auth.admin.key_store]` (the `admin-ui`
feature)

- **Stores:** one argon2id verifier per managed key, the key id, the
  creation and revocation times, and the key's admission policy (model
  and provider globs, rate windows, budget). **Never** a plaintext token:
  the issued `<key-id>.<secret>` token is shown exactly once at creation.
- **Where:** the configured SQLite file.
- **Retention:** until revoked; revoked rows are kept (they stop
  authenticating immediately) until the operator deletes the store.

### Replica stores — `[replica]` (the `store-redis` / `store-postgres`
features)

- **Stores:** the same data the in-process admission state holds —
  per-caller request counts, token reservations, micro-USD spend and
  reservations, in-flight slot counts, lease records (caller, member,
  model, reserved amounts), cooldown reset times, and usage events as
  JSON (the same ledger rows, no prompt or response bytes). No prompt or
  response content crosses this seam; the body digest is the only body
  derivative.
- **Where:** the configured Redis (keyed under the shared prefix; keys
  expire on their window TTLs, leases after 1h) or Postgres (the
  replica schema; window rows are purged on a timer).
- **Retention:** window rows live only as long as their window (plus a
  bounded grace); usage events live until the operator drains or drops
  them.

### MCP gateway — `[mcp]` (the `mcp-gateway` feature)

- **Stores:** nothing persistent. Gateway sessions (token id, first and
  last seen) live in process memory and age out after `session_ttl`.
  Tool calls write the same usage-ledger rows as chat (route kind
  `mcp`), with explicitly zero token usage. The gateway relays tool-call
  arguments to the configured upstream MCP servers — the same egress the
  proxy performs for chat — and retains none of them.

### Guardrails — the `llm-proxy-guardrails` crate

- **Stores:** nothing. Guards are configuration (patterns, actions);
  masking rewrites text in flight. Fail-policy choices are logged as
  events, without the text that triggered them.

## Not built

- Payload logging and shadow evaluation are not in the proxy.
- Subscription OAuth and client fingerprinting are out of scope; see the
  [credentials decision](goal.md#credentials).
